# Mind Reader Game

A simple command-line "Mind Reader" game implemented in Batch scripting. The script prompts the user to pick a number between 1 and 100, then either guesses the number or generates a random number if the input falls outside the range.

## Features:
- Input validation to ensure the number is a valid integer between 1 and 100.
- If the number is valid, it guesses the number; if not, it generates a random number.
- User-friendly prompts and exit messages.

## Requirements:
- Windows operating system (Batch scripting environment).

## How to Use:
1. Download or clone the repository.
2. Run the `MindReader.bat` file in a Command Prompt.
3. Follow the on-screen prompts to pick a number, and enjoy the game!
